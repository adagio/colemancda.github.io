Today I took apart my iMac G3 and put my Hackintosh motherboard inside. I also replaced the CRT screen for an LCD. I haven’t finished the conversion yet. I need to get the front power button, audio jacks and speakers to work with my rig. I’ll finish the conversion when I have more free time. In the meanwhile, my computer is functional, only needing to cross two wires in order the power the computer. My Hackintosh has OS X Lion 10.7 running at 32 bits with 2 GB of Ram with a WiFi card recognized as Airport.
