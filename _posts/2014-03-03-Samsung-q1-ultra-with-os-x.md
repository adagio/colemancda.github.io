Two months ago I discovered that the $1500 Samsung Q1 Ultra Premium I wanted when I was 12 now costs $150. I also bought a $80 Samsung Q1 Ultra (the difference being 800 MHZ Pentium vs 1.6 GHZ Intel Core Solo). I put OS X 10.6.8 in the Ultra Premium and OS X 10.5.8. Both have calibration issues that can be fixed with a $200 third-party driver but it work fine for my uses. I mainly use it to play Age of Mythology and Bejeweled 3 on a touchscreen.
