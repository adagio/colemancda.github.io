Today I released NetworkObjects [v1.1][releaselink]. Numerous bugs have been fixed and unit tests have been added. I started the process of writing servers in for OS X in May 2013. 2 years and numerous rewrites later, I can proudly say that I have built a stable framework that does just that. Even better, it uses Swift which is truly an enjoyable language to work with. While I dont expect any Swift backend services to appear anytime soon, NetworkObjects is really usable for quick prototyping of web services, enterprise servers, and its Store class can be used to communicate with a backend written in another language (as long as it follows the same JSON, REST API schema).
