More than a year ago I released Wi-Fi Crack (originally WEP Crack), a tool that allows you to use your Mac to crack a WEP Wi-Fi network. A year and 60k downloads later, I decided to update the app. Being the second Mac app I’ve made for distribution (BMI Calculator was  first), the code was hideous. I decided to nuke the old code and rewrite it from scratch. The only code I transferred was the Apple Script code which allows me to launch the command line tools for capturing and cracking packets. I would have preferred to use NSTask instead of Apple Script but I’m not enrolled in the Mac Developer program and thus cannot sign code, which is needed for launching tasks with privileges. It took me six hours to rewrite the app and I enjoyed it. Using the knowledge I’ve gained as an iOS developer, I’ve crafted the UI to be simple and beautiful. AirCrack-NG has been compiled for multiple CPU architectures and now only WEP networks can be selected for cracking and capturing.  Also, the app takes you step-by-step through the process with conditionally-enabled “Next” buttons. Theoretically, it is possible to crack a WPA network on a Mac using AirCrack-NG, but you need special hardware to capture the packets, which will not support the CoreWLAN framework I must use for selecting the wireless interface and network.
